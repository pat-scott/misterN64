# MiSTerN64
My goal here is to stick a MiSTerFPGA board in an N64 shell for a great looking under the TV box that plays NES, SNES and N64.
Seeing all the hype around the Analog 3d has given me a craving to play though Ocarina of Time again, which got me thinking I should really play through the whole Legend of Zelda series... 

Ive never really been satisfied with N64 emulation on most small under-the-tv boxes (Raspberry Pi etc) and I've been looking for a new project so I decided to put a [MiSTerFPGA](https://mister-devel.github.io/MkDocs_MiSTer/) build together, and to make it look beautiful in the living room its going inside an N64.

Whilst I'm concentrating on classic Nintendo consoles for now, once I've played through the main-game Zelda series on NES, SNES and N64, I'll probably branch out into some other cores to make this the ultimate 16 bit and under emulation box (NEO-GEO next, then the Sega series of consoles!)

## The donor N64
All I want here is the shell really, so I brought a broken N64 from ebay and a repro Majoras mask cart from Ali Express.
