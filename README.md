# misterN64

## My goal here is to stick a MiSTerFPGA board in an N64 shell for a great looking under the TV box that plays NES, SNES and N64.
Seeing all the hype around the Analog 3d has given me a craving to play though Ocarina of Time again, which got me thinking i should really play through the whole Legend of Zelda series... 

As I've been looking for a new project I decided to put a [MiSTerFPGA](https://mister-devel.github.io/MkDocs_MiSTer/) build together.

## The donor N64
All I want here is the shell really, so I brought a broken N64 from ebay and a repro Majoras mask cart from Ali Express.
